Overview

This Java program performs basic arithmetic operations and generates a Fibonacci sequence based on user input. Additionally, it calculates the sum, mean, variance, and standard deviation of the Fibonacci series.

Features

Accepts user input for arithmetic operations (sum, difference, multiplication, and division)

Generates a Fibonacci sequence of a given length

Calculates statistical measures for the Fibonacci sequence:

Sum

Mean

Variance

Standard Deviation

Usage

The program will prompt for two numbers to perform arithmetic operations.

It will then ask for the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

The generated Fibonacci sequence, along with statistical calculations, will be displayed.
